# zax-tensor
Yet another tensor library in C++. It allows direct access to its underlying data buffer, and serializes in JSON. Built on top of zax json parser, C++ structures having tensor members can also be JSON-serialized and deserialized, allowing one to save and load the state of a highly hierarchical object.
